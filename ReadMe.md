Machine Learning problems that tackle scale. 

* Out of core learning, Stochastic Learning
* Fast Support Vector Machines using Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Classification and Regression: Bagging(Bootstrap aggregation), CART, Boosting(Gradient Boosting Machines), Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost)
* Unsupervised Learning: PCA at scale, K-means, Latent Dirichlet Allocation for unseen text analysis.
* Setting up a Hadoop cluster and running MapReduce jobs. 
* Spark projects
